### Clear winner
Powerplus with its higher warrantee, safety slip clutch, higher cord length and included drills and chisels. Specifically the **Powerplus POWX1195** with the highest RPM, highest BPM and highest Impact Energy at the lowest price. Best value for money and still a great review score.

### Addition info
- **Bit:** Use with a high quality Four-Cutter Carbide-Tipped SDS-Plus Bit from a reputable brand for the best results. Make sure the drill is rated for the same or higher RPM speeds of the machine.
- **Hammer Drilling**: For hammer drilling, only a slight pressure force is necessary. Too much pressure force unnecessarily stresses the motor.
- **Safety:** Use high quality ear protection (above 85db) and use high quality eye protection (safety glasses). It is not adviced to use gloves *when drilling* because the glove, and thus the hand/arm can be caught by the rotating parts. Use heat and scratch protecive gloves when changing drills. Disconnect the machine before changing drills. Be aware the drill may be hot after usage. Check and protect the cable from fluids before usage. When using the drill outdoor, connect using splashproof outlets.
